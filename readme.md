# ‚ùì About SimpleHealth

- _SimpleHealth allows players in-game to give themselves health and armor, but also makes it so vehicle crashing comes with a price. Rather than htiting vehicles at high speeds and not having issues, this script makes it so anything above 100MPH will kill the player and also cause their screen to blackout. However, not only that but when they are driving slower but still speeding (65+) they will still take damage if they crash into a wall, or another vehicle._

# ‚ùì How to install SimpleHealth
